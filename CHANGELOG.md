# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## Unreleased

### Fixed

- `repl-history` extension: support Eat terminals ([#154](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/issues/154)).


### Added

- `ob-julia` extension: new configuration option: `julia-snail/ob-julia-resource-directory` ([#146](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/pull/146)).
- Update the REPL's `ans` variable after evaluating something through Snail.
- `debug` extension added, which integrates `DebugAdapter` and `dape` for REPL debugging.
- `julia-snail-analyze-includes`: a new approach for handling nested modules.


### Changed

- **Breaking change:** Switched from `CSTParser` to `JuliaSyntax` ([#149](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/issues/149)). Because `JuliaSyntax` ships with Julia versions 1.10 and later, and because I don't want to maintain `Project.toml` files in Snail itself, this means support for older Julia versions is discontinued.
- Standardized on using `locate-library` to locate Snail's installation ([#147](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/issues/147)).


## [1.3.2] ‚Äî 2024-02-27

### Fixed

- Make `julia-snail-repl-completion-at-point` try to work even when not connected to Snail ([#142](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/pull/142)).
- Fix returning `missing` values ([#143](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/issues/143)).


## [1.3.1] ‚Äî 2024-01-17

### Fixed

- Invoke the `julia` binary using the `-i` (interactive mode) flag to clarify that the Snail process is, indeed, interactive (see [OhMyREPL.jl #337](https://github.com/KristofferC/OhMyREPL.jl/issues/337) and [#140](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/issues/140)).


## [1.3.0] ‚Äî 2024-01-17

### Fixed

- Looking up completions now works even if there is a running computational task in the REPL ([#123](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/issues/123)).
- Byte-compiler warning in Emacs 29 ([#129](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/pull/129)).


### Added

- Support for Eat as an alternative to vterm.
- `julia-snail-interrupt-task`: a new interface function which allows interrupting a running computational task in the Julia REPL ([#104](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/issues/104)).


### Changed

- Removed `vterm` from list of automatic dependencies. Since installing it never worked automatically anyway, this should not be a breaking change.



## [1.2.3] ‚Äî 2023-05-30

### Fixed

- Incompatibility if `package.el` is not loaded ([#122](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/issues/122)).


## [1.2.2] ‚Äî 2023-05-07

### Fixed

- A client socket tracking bug introduced in 1.2.1 ([#121](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/issues/121)).


## [1.2.1] ‚Äî 2023-05-02

### Fixed

- A networking bug which sometimes caused infinte loops connecting to remote REPLs ([#54](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/issues/54#issuecomment-1518170908), [#120](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/issues/120)).


### Added

- Support for using Tramp methods `scp` and `scpx` in addition to the existing `ssh` method for remote REPLs ([#120](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/issues/120)).


## [1.2.0] ‚Äî 2023-03-31

### Fixed

- A problem where certain Julia forms were not correctly evaluated as top-level.
- Bug with direct-to-REPL evaluation with `julia-snail-repl-display-eval-results` turned off.
- Scrolling display bug with multimedia images (plots) with `julia-snail-multimedia-buffer-style` set to `:multi` ([#112](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/issues/112)).
- A problem where `julia-snail-popup-display-eval-results` set to `:change` caused a serious slowdown ([#110](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/issues/110)).


### Added

- New configuration setting: `julia-snail-repl-display-eval-results`. When set to `t` (defaults to `nil`), it prints the result of evaluating some code from Emacs to the REPL.
- New extension: `ob-julia`, which adds Julia support to Org Babel.
- Results of running code from source buffers are now shown inline using overlays. See `julia-snail-popup-display-eval-results` for details.
- Improved support for Imenu integration. See documentation for `julia-snail-imenu-style`.
- Menu bar entries for main Snail mode and Snail REPL mode.


### Changed

- **Breaking change:** `julia-snail-send-line` no longer just copies the line at point to the REPL ignoring module context. It evaluates the line in the module context instead. This makes it consistent with `julia-snail-send-region` and `julia-snail-send-top-level-form`. The old behavior is still available with two prefix arguments (i.e.: `C-u C-u M-x julia-snail-send-line` or `C-u C-u C-c C-l`).
- `julia-snail-send-region` now supports using two prefix arguments to _copy_ the region to the REPL and evaluate it, ignoring module context (i.e.: `C-u C-u M-x julia-snail-send-region` or `C-u C-u C-c C-r`).
* Breaking change: `julia-snail-company-doc-enable` setting renamed to `julia-snail-completions-doc-enable`. It now supports [`corfu-doc`](https://github.com/galeo/corfu-doc) in addition to [`company-quickhelp`](https://www.github.com/expez/company-quickhelp).


## [1.1.5] ‚Äî 2022-02-17

### Fixed

- When a Julia-side dependency of Snail (like CSTParser) has already been installed in the Julia global environment, it can cause conflicts (see [#62](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/issues/62)). Work around this problem by forcing the Snail Julia project to be first in `LOAD_PATH` order, but only during initial Snail load.
- Local REPLs should start with the same working directory as the starting file ([#69](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/issues/69)).
- A bug that kept the spinner running in a source buffer when a multimedia image about to be displayed ([#73](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/pull/73)).


### Added

- Support for running Julia instances in Docker containers using Tramp.
- Support for evaluating code in notebook-style code-cells (https://github.com/astoff/code-cells.el).
- Support for Snail extensions. See [README](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail#extensions) and [EXTENSIONS](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/blob/master/EXTENSIONS.md) files for details.
- New extension: `repl-history`, which allows searching and yanking REPL history in source buffers.
- New extension: `formatter`, a wrapper for [JuliaFormatter.jl](https://github.com/domluna/JuliaFormatter.jl).


### Changed

- The modeline lighter now shows a üêå emoji instead of the string `"Snail"` (unless `julia-snail-use-emoji-mode-lighter` is `nil` or overriden elsewhere). Excellent idea from the discussion in [#70](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/issues/70).


## [1.1.4] ‚Äî 2021-08-17

### Fixed

- Some versions of [`emacs-libvterm`](https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm) notice that `default-directory` of a buffer points to a remote host and hijack the `ssh` invocation. Prevent this from conflicting with Snail's own use of `ssh`.


## [1.1.3] ‚Äî 2021-08-12

No functionality changes. Only documentation updates.


## [1.1.2] ‚Äî 2021-08-11

### Fixed

- Fixed a potential bug if there is a different default username configured for the ssh remote host in `.ssh/config` from the one used in the Tramp connection string (i.e., if `.ssh/config` says `myhost` should use default username `myname1` but the Tramp connection string is `/ssh:myname2@myhost:`).


## [1.1.1] ‚Äî 2021-08-07

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug (regression) which caused `julia-snail-send-region' to only work on regions containing a single expression.


## [1.1.0] ‚Äî 2021-08-06

### Added

- Support for remote REPLs through SSH and Tramp.
- Support for the Julia multimedia interface (i.e. plots) in graphical Emacs builds.


### Fixed

- Source location for separately evaluated top-level forms or regions now points to the original source, instead of temporary files ([#28](https://github.com/gcv/julia-snail/issues/28)).
- Improved compatibility with Revise.


## [1.0.0] ‚Äî 2021-03-30

First reasonably stable release.


## [1.0.0beta6] ‚Äî 2020-03-15

First public release.
