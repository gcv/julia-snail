;; XXX: One of vterm or eat must be manually installed before Snail starts.
;; Picking one or the other involves tradeoffs best left to the user, and
;; therefore neither is added to the Package-Requires header. Briefly, vterm
;; supports older versions of Emacs (down to 26) but has more complicated module
;; compilation needs. Eat is a simpler dependency, but requires Emacs 28. The
;; two emulate terminals differently, and so one may be preferable to the other
;; for other reasons.
